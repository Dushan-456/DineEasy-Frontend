# DineEasy-Frontend
This project  DineEasy focuses on designing a simple and mindful digital ordering companion that makes it easier for diners to manage their meal. The main idea is to create a clear, calm, and user-friendly interface, accessed via a QR code, where diners can browse the menu, place their order, and see its status without any social pressure.
